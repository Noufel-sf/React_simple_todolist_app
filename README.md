# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


üìù React To-Do List App
This is a simple and functional React to-do list application built to practice core React concepts.

‚úÖ What I Learned
React State Management: Used useState to handle dynamic UI updates for tasks.

Local Storage Integration: Implemented localStorage with useEffect to persist tasks between browser sessions.

Component Reusability: Created and used a reusable Task child component to manage individual task rendering and actions.

Task Functionality: Added core to-do list features:

Add new tasks

Delete tasks

Toggle task completion

React Hooks: Applied useEffect correctly for syncing data and managing side effects.

JSX & Styling: Gained experience in writing clean JSX and styling using Tailwind CSS classes.

Code Cleanup: Improved understanding of managing state initialization from local storage efficiently.
